# decenteralized-medical-record-system

## Intro 
The aim of this project is to develop a Decentralized Medical Record System where every patient has a medical record shared among all related stakeholders of the healthcare network. Medical records are shared using the Blockchain technology. This system would improve the overall services for patients, and guarantee that medical records are perpetually free of any alterations, which provides privacy services to ensure role-based access.
